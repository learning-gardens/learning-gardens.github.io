Intro:

Welcome to Learning Gardens' source. It's a static site built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/), in the form of [Jekyons](https://tinychime.github.io/jekyons/).

If you're looking for general information on Learning Gardens itself, this might be a bit more useful: https://github.com/learning-gardens/-meta

Technical Details:

Currently this site is being hosted and served via Github Pages. It is simple and lovely and does the trick.

The imagery on the site have been designed by the members of each respective group/garden. We're orchestrating that effort on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/HA4zT2i5Yb2fd7Z1u24qOvNJ/Template-%E2%80%94-Site-Cover-Images), in a shared asset-generation document.
