<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure">Learning Gardens is a <span class="i ttu">meta-organization</span> —<br />a “network of self-organized learning groups”.</p>
<p class="ml5 lh-copy measure-narrow">At its simplest, this means we want to help you <span class="">start</span> and run your own learning group.</p>
<p class="ml6 lh-copy measure-narrow">At its best, we hope you and your friends achieve nirvana.</p>
<p class="ml7 lh-copy measure-narrow">Joining is free and driven by you.</p>
<p class="ml5 lh-copy measure-narrow">We encourage you to realize how much existing infrastructure for learning exists in the form of people, places, and resources.</p>

<p class="dib ml0 b">What does Learning Gardens do?</p>
<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-narrow">We help you join a <a class="green link" href="/groups.html">learning group</a> or start your own. A group (or “garden”) is a collection of people investigating a particular set of ideas.</p>
<p class="ml5 lh-copy measure-narrow">As a collective/container, we host a number of platforms and resources to support people taking agency in learning outside of institutions.</p>
<!--   <p class="ml6 lh-copy measure-narrow">Within Learning Gardens' substrate, we acknowledge several loose “types” of groups, <a class="green link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15_JVGipvgCTOCEreDxaWTf6u7e4TOuWBPXxSa44448s/edit?usp=sharing">each an organizational paradigm</a>.</p> -->

<!--  How to join LG?  -->
<p class="dib ml0 b">How do I join a garden?</p>
<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-narrow">We recommend you first look at our <a class="green link" href="/groups.html">list of groups</a> and decide which is of interest. </p>
<p class="ml5 lh-copy measure-narrow">If appropriate, join a conversation platform (such as Slack or Discourse) that the learning group uses to organize, then introduce yourself.</p>
