<p class="di i">To everyone,</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">One thing to realize about Learning Gardens <br>
is that it was never "about a place".</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">We say the above realizing in a way, that Learning Gardens<br>
was never <i>actually</i> meant to be "a thing", <br>
or to be "governed" by only a few people.</p> 

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">We repeat often in passing that Learning Gardens<br>
was an attempt at a *means* by which one enters a<br>
state of learning (growing, sharing, experiencing) <br>
with-and-alongside others without<br>
necessarily feeling the pang of obligation one feels<br>
in a book club (for example), or in a classroom with<br>
homework and grading systems.</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">Inspired heavily by the anarchist notion of <br>
"Temporary Autonomous Zones", we semi-jokingly<br>
referred to Learning Gardens as a<br>
"Non-Obligational Autonomous Zone", a place where<br>
one's educational path was self-derived and not<br>
subject to other structures that might be imposed on it.</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">In a way, Learning Gardens has continually attempted<br>
to nurture a sense that "dying is OK", in the sense that<br>
no learning initiative can remain fervently active, or<br>
remain relevant forever. In a sense, we should be happy<br>
to realize some gardens can't hold <br>
our collective attentions forever.</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">Again,
Learning Gardens was never "about a place".</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">Ian Hamilton Finlay said, rather, that <a href="https://www.are.na/block/2053044" target="none">"a garden is not an object but a process"</a>.</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">~</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">In 2019 we're going to retire our Slack as a sort<br>
of "central hub" that many folks found it or made it to be.</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">Learning Gardens is about support structures in learning.</p>
<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">Learning Gardens is about self-organization in education.</p>
<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">Learning Gardens is about a disposition, not a place. </p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">Learning Gardens has always been about diffusing off<br>
into whatever platform made sense for its participants,<br>
and we're hoping everyone currently using Slack as their<br>
"Learning Gardens" can become stewards of their own<br>
learning experiences, in whatever manner they see fit.</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">The current janitors of Learning Gardens also<br>
want some downtime from whatever loose <br>
community management we had cobbled together over the years.<br>
We don't need to be the bottlenecks. </p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">The current janitors additionally want to experiment with<br>
what it means for Learning Gardens to implement itself<br>
through new technologies that actually mirror the ideals<br>
it was established around. </p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">We realize for members not based in major hubs, <br>
or places with many other gardeners, this might be annoying<br>
news at best, heartbreaking news at worst, <br>
but we're hoping in the month that follows this letter, we can all find ways of connecting with one another as needed. <br> The net is vast and infinite.</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">It's never goodbye! Upon the completion of this process, we'll all still be around.<br>
Learning Gardens will continue to grow slow.</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80">Love,</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-80-narrow">We help you join a <a class="green link" href="/groups.html">learning group</a> or start your own. A group (or “garden”) is a collection of people investigating a particular set of ideas.</p>
<p class="ml5 lh-copy measure-ns w-80-narrow">Our connections are your connections; our experience is your experience. </p>
<p class="ml6 lh-copy measure-ns w-80-narrow">As a collective/container, we host a number of platforms and resources to support people taking agency in learning outside of institutions.</p> -->
<!--   <p class="ml6 lh-copy measure-ns w-80-narrow">Within Learning Gardens' substrate, we acknowledge several loose “types” of groups, <a class="green link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15_JVGipvgCTOCEreDxaWTf6u7e4TOuWBPXxSa44448s/edit?usp=sharing">each an organizational paradigm</a>.</p> -->
