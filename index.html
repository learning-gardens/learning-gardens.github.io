<p class="di i">To everyone,</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">One thing to realize about Learning Gardens 
is that it was never "about a place".</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">We say this, realizing that Learning Gardens
was never meant to be "a thing," 
or to consist of or be "governed" by
only a few people.</p> 

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">We repeat often in passing that Learning Gardens
was an attempt at a *means* by which one enters a
state of learning (growing, sharing, experiencing) 
with and alongside others without
necessarily feeling the pang of obligation one feels
in a book club (for example), or in a classroom with
homework and grading systems.</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">Inspired heavily by the anarchist notion of 
"Temporary Autonomous Zones", we semi-jokingly
referred to Learning Gardens as a
"Non-Obligational Autonomous Zone", a place where
one's educational path was self-derived and not
subject to other structures that might be imposed on it.</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">In a way, Learning Gardens has continually attempted
to nurture a sense that "dying is OK", in the sense that
no learning initiative can remain fervently active, or
remain relevant forever. In a sense, we should be happy
to realize some gardens can't hold 
our collective attentions forever.</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">Again,
Learning Gardens was never "about a place".</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">Ian Hamilton Finlay said, rather, that <a href="www.are.na/block/2053044">"a garden is not an object but a process"</a>.</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">~</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">In 2019 we're going to retire our Slack as a sort
of "central hub" that many folks found it or made it to be.</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">Learning Gardens is about support structures in learning.</p>
<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">Learning Gardens is about self-organization in education.</p>
<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">Learning Gardens is about a disposition, not a place. </p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">Learning Gardens has always been about diffusing off
into whatever platform made sense for its participants,
and we're hoping everyone currently using Slack as their
"Learning Gardens" can become stewards of their own
learning experiences, in whatever manner they see fit.</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">The current janitors of Learning Gardens also
want some downtime from whatever loose 
community management we had cobbled together over the years.
We don't need to be the bottlenecks. </p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">The current janitors want to experiment with
what it means for Learning Gardens to implement itself
through new technologies that actually mirror the ideals
it was established around. </p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">We realize for members not based in major hubs, 
or places with many other gardeners, this might be annoying
news at best, heartbreaking news at worst, 
but we're hoping in the month that follows this letter we can all find ways of connecting with one another as needed.</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">After this is said and done, we'll still be around.
Learning Gardens will continue to grow slow.</p>

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">Love,</p>
<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">Janitorial Staff</p>

<!-- <p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100">Learning Gardens is a <span class="i ttu">meta-organization</span> —<br />a “network of self-organized learning groups”.</p>
<p class="ml5 lh-copy measure-ns w-100-narrow">At its simplest, this means we want to help you <span class="">start</span> and run your own learning group.</p>
<p class="ml6 lh-copy measure-ns w-100-narrow">At its best, we hope you and your friends achieve nirvana.</p>
<p class="ml7 lh-copy measure-ns w-100-narrow">Joining is free and driven by you.</p>
<p class="ml5 lh-copy measure-ns w-100-narrow">We encourage you to realize how much existing infrastructure for learning exists in the form of people, places, and resources around you.</p> -->

<p class="ml3 lh-copy measure-ns w-100-narrow">We help you join a <a class="green link" href="/groups.html">learning group</a> or start your own. A group (or “garden”) is a collection of people investigating a particular set of ideas.</p>
<p class="ml5 lh-copy measure-ns w-100-narrow">Our connections are your connections; our experience is your experience. </p>
<p class="ml6 lh-copy measure-ns w-100-narrow">As a collective/container, we host a number of platforms and resources to support people taking agency in learning outside of institutions.</p> -->
<!--   <p class="ml6 lh-copy measure-ns w-100-narrow">Within Learning Gardens' substrate, we acknowledge several loose “types” of groups, <a class="green link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15_JVGipvgCTOCEreDxaWTf6u7e4TOuWBPXxSa44448s/edit?usp=sharing">each an organizational paradigm</a>.</p> -->
